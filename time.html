In the earlier Blog 3 we understood that we should trade with value over the time.
To facilitate ‘Value’, it is necessary to look in to various possibilities that will enhance the mindset for the ability to cultivate ‘value’ to encounter innovative ideas.</p>
<p>
<b>‘Concentration’ is such finest quality innovate-value proposition with coherent speed in our work culture.</b></p>
<p>
As Swami Vivekananda puts it, “How has all the knowledge in the world been gained by the concentration of the powers of the mind? The world is ready to give up its secretes if we only knew how to knock, how to give it to necessary blow. The strength and force of the blow come through concentration. There is no limit to the power of human mind.The more concentrated it is the more power it is brought to bear on one point; that is the secret”</p>
<p>
<h3>How to develop ‘concentration’ and evolve that intelligible ‘Value’ at your work place??</h3></p>
<p>
The subjugate qualities of likes, dislikes, biases, envy, jealousy and frustration, etc., are the reasons for distraction. Therefore, ‘thoughts controlling us’ rather than ‘we control our thoughts’. The simple solution is - If we can remove the ‘emotional component’ from our thoughts, they (thoughts) will come under our control.</p>
<p>
<h3>How to separate emotional component from our thoughts??</h3></p>
<p>
Clearly, separating mind from combining too many things with our thoughts means that we should consciously stop consequential sub-thoughts, which is the result of emotions.Once the interference of unwanted thoughts is eliminated we can focus our minds; thereby the capability to be ‘innovative’ will bring <i>excellence</i> whichever the work we do.
<p>
<b>Therefore - Think before you Think!!</b></p>
<p>
When I was in research, I used to spend 100 hours of work in a week, and am a capable of working at a stretch for a several hours to develop the product by adding value to my time with coherent speed. Similarly we find many professionals like doctors, advocates, charted accountants, software professionals, who also have the capability to work with highest levels of concentration for several hours at a stretch by adding value to their work, bringing excellence to their profession. This value proposition will enhance your command higher reward points in the work you do.
<p>
Meditation is increasingly gaining its popularity as a tool for concentration in this tech-era.</p>
When the mind has been trained to stay fixed on a certain internal or external location, there comes to it the power of flowing in, an unbroken current, as it were, towards that point. That is called <b>Meditation</b> as defined by Swami Vivekananda!!</p>
