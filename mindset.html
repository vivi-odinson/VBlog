								<p>One day, when I was in the final year of my engineering graduation, I was talking to one of my classmates regarding my ambitions of buying a car one day, when purchasing a two-wheeler was itself a dream at that point of time in 1998!  One of them, hailing from a lower-middle-class status himself, laughed at me and said "Coming from a lower-middle-class family, what is that you are dreaming?". I said, "Why not? I will have my Jet one day!" My friend started to laugh and told me that I had gone crazy. "Why not?" I said. 
</p><p>
The only limit our mind has is the one we set for ourselves. If we limit ourselves to owning only the two-wheeler, then our efforts will only be limited to owning a two-wheeler. Not like it's impossible to own a car at the age of 24, right? Is it impossible to own a jet even in one's entire lifetime?? 
</p><p>
People called me a day-dreamer and advised me to have realistic goals. And that's the thing. We are so focused on disappointing ourselves if we failed, that we do not want to set goals we deem to be beyond our boundary. This mindset is what our family, our friends and even our mentors imbibe in us- Be realistic. Have realistic goals. Be happy and satisfied with what you have. 
</p><p>
So I ponder...Why do we need to think small and just be glad that we have a house to live in and have food to eat?? Why do you need to compare yourself with those below your social status? Is that the benchmark you want to feel satisfied upon hitting??
</p><p>
I am not saying I'm not grateful for all that I have. All I ask is why is it unfair to I think big and set my benchmark against people who are a hundred times ahead of me?? 
Why can't I be super successful? 
I am glad that those pioneering Millenials conquered their mediocre mindset, which is why we live in a comfortable world today.
</p><p>
It's not hard to observe that every great story set off with not settling for the ordinary. Just think about it. What if the Wright Brothers, Henry Ford, or Thomas Edison abided by the realistic society's limiting beliefs? 
</p><p>
A mediocre thought is a contraction of mindset. What you need is the expansion and here is the newly wealthy, ambitious mindset. Have a crazy ambition. If people don't laugh at your goals, then it is not big enough a dream. That won't get you to experience the horizon.</p>
<p>
As Swamiji puts it, "All expansion is life & all contraction is death".
</p><p>
Being a stammerer, when I decided to take a job in the Sales sector, I was told by my boss that I was crazy. I am sure many of my ex-colleagues made fun of me when they knew I had shifted from Research to Sales side in an attempt to aid my customers to sell the right product. 
</p><p>
That is when I knew I was on the right track of my ambition, and I kept going!
</p><p>
Have big juicy goals because the bigger the goal, the more would be the effort.
</p><p>
Always remember, "What you think is what you are". Therefore, watch your thoughts and altogether reject any of those mediocre thoughts that pop in your head. Cultivate the quality of your thinking and forever forge a millionaire mindset.
</p><p>
Convert your knowledge, skills and abilities into a powerful destiny. A destiny that will change the lives of people around you and the world because we are here to live merely, but to make a difference and to live our making. </p>
