								<p>Have you thought of working for yourself and enjoying your own freedom? </p>

<p>I was enjoying my work in the research field when I was forced to take up a sales job. I didn't like the sales role for a couple of years. I felt that the sales job was all about forcing people to buy my products. I felt like people hated me for calling them, forcing them to buy it. I felt fear of rejection and everything else that meant I was not happy with my job. </p>

<p>"If you don't love what you do, then either do what you love or start loving what you do", is a saying often heard.</p>

<p>The day I committed to my job and decided to love it, things changed for real. I started to realise that only excellence will create professionalism that creates space for value. Value alone can command and demand something that you deserve. </p>

<p>The word "yoga" refers to doing work excellently as Shankaracharya puts it, Yogasya Karmasu Kousalam !! </p>

<p>Being excellent is a value proposition of a free mind. 
A slavery mindset trades with time wherein, the free mindset will trade with value. 
Find that passion which will give value to your customer and sell that value. 
This value comes from skill. Knowledge, that is consistently performed results in expertise, which is generated from the work that you love the most. If you do not love your work you can never generate skill, and thereby value. Then you are just a slave who is trading with time. Better quit that work! </p>
<p>Love demands risk. If you are not a risk-lover, you cannot master your skills. 
Imagine being an ultimate sales machine who could sell anything to anyone in any given situation. That means you have mastered your skills in Sales. Masterly mind sells the product by its value and not by price. You are adding value to your customer pain points. </p>
<p>Do remember, here you are exchanging customers' money with your value and not with your time. 
It not only sounds easy, but is doable. </p>
It will require immense effort at the early stages for sure. But once you have established your strong suits, and add enough value to your customer, your business will prosper.</p></p>
<p>On the contrary, people who trade with time don't take risks. Because they are not masters of their craft and are afraid of losing money/ happiness, they are comfortable in their cosy jobs. 
Therefore, the bottom line is to become the best at what you do, and you can command higher reward points when you trade with value. </p>

<p>The key to all this is having a greedy mindset! Yes, you heard me right. Only for lazy, the word greed is a negative notion. But not for those ambitious who aspires for ample money, freedom and excellence!</p></p>

<p>Greed is good. That is the hungry beast mindset for people who want to experience the finest quality of life. </p>

<p>Now that I have started producing the results, I am so happy I am in Sales. This role has changed my life, given me the opportunity to make good money, travel around
and boost my self-confidence. </p>
