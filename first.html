								<p>What's it that you're mad about? Sure,there must be something that's driving you to be an entreprenuer! Something that people most often call you "mad" for. Because if people don't call you crazy, then you're probably stupid. </p>
								<p>
								PASSION - Take this as the first step in laying out a solid foundation for your entreprenuerial journey. While most of us sort of know what we're passionate about, there's still many of us who haven't found ours yet. If you belong to the latter part, read on. </p>
								<p>
								Firstly, more often than not, we're confused between ‘habit’ and ‘passion’. While your hobby could be something you love doing, perhaps something you enjoy doing, it's also something you won't mind quitting. 
								Because that's what it is! An <i>external factor</i> which needs to you to depend on something else to give you that sense of enjoyment. I enjoy riding a car. I drive often and long rides are kind of my hobby now. But I've got to depedn on a car to enjoy this.</p>
								<p>
								Now PASSION- here's all the difference! It's what you call <b>"the hunger"</b>. The hunger that fuels the desire within you. Something you're crazy about achieving. Something that won't let you sleep. Because that's what passion does to you. And if all this doesn't have people calling you crazy, then you're probably stupid.
							    </p>
								Sri Ramakrishna was called "mad" by his own people for being passionate about realising Maa Kaali!
								</p>
								<p>And yet, there's one thing both habit and passion share- the inability to quantify either of them with money. Neither is money the driving factor for nor is it something you can't not do without. Nevertheless, <b>money is definitely a by-product</b>of being passionate about something. Because passion cannot vary with time and place. </p>

								<p>						 
								Then that leads us to the next question- <b>How to develop your Passion? </b> </p>
								<p>
								In Swami Vivekanandas' words, "Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life - think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success. If we really want to be blessed, and make others blessed, we must go deeper. (I.177)"
							</p>
							<p> While you get yourself on this plane, it's plausible you might lose your current set of friends, some of your habits, your routine...you might as well get hugely critizised.</p>
							<p> But you know it's all worth something, right?</p>
							<p> Because at the end of the day, it's your amibition that matters. When mission builds arounf your passion, it turns into obsession. And that is your right to win and to celebrate the life of your choice. And remember, if they're not calling you crazy, then you're probably stupid!</p>
